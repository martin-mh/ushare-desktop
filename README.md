## Don't be scared to contribute
We hope you will contribute by sending some pull request to enhance uShare. Don't forget to add your name at the top of the file you edited. We use semantic versionning.

## Languages
This software is available in english and french. We are looking for some translators.

## How to build
Feel free to edit uShare and rebuild it. To build it you will need QtCreator. We are fully working with Linux and Windows but we still have some work for OS X.

### Qt 5.5.0
Qt 5.5.0 has some troubles on Linux and on Windows. If you want to get ready as fast as possible, I advise you to use Qt 5.4.2 instead.
